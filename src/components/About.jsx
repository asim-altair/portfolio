      <p>
        Hi there! I’m a passionate web developer with a love for creating both
        functional and visually appealing digital experiences. With a background
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Photoshop, I enjoy bringing ideas to life
        through clean and efficient code. I’m also proficient in C# and Unity
        3D, which has allowed me to explore game development and enhance my
        problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve had the opportunity to work on a few personal projects, including
        web applications and a simple game, which have been a great way for me
        to learn and grow. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and
        improve my craft. My goal is to continue expanding my skills and take on
        new challenges, all while contributing to impactful projects. I’m
        excited about the possibility of working with a team where I can both
        contribute and learn. If you're looking for a dedicated developer who's
        always striving to grow, let's connect!
